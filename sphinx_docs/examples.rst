Examples
========

Welcome to the Examples Page! Here, you will find a variety of examples that demonstrate the capabilities and usage of PT3S. Each example is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.ipynb` file. 

The examples calculate the necessary SIR 3S results as MX files using your local SIR Calc. Therefore, you need to specify the path to your `SirCalc.exe` inside the notebook. After calculating them once, you can set this option to `False`. Please ensure that you have the **newest version** of PT3S installed to be able to run all examples. This is because most examples use data that was added to the `PT3S/Examples` directory in a specific release.
