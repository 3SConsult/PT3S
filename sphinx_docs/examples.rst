Examples
========

Welcome to the Examples Page! Here, you will find a variety of examples that demonstrate the capabilities and usage of PT3S. Each example is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.ipynb` file. 

In the Example-Notebooks the corresponding SIR 3S Example-Models are (re-)calculated using your local SirCalc.

.. _ex0:

Example 0: Installation 
-----------------------

This example does not demonstrate use cases of PT3S, but gives an overview over important commands to install, administer and import PT3S.

.. _ex1:

Example 1: Interactive Map and Network Color Diagram
----------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates how GeoDataFrames (gdfs) created by PT3S can be used with geopandas' explore for interactive maps with folium/leaflet.js and with geopandas' plot with matplotlib.

.. _ex2:

Example 2: Time Curves
----------------------

This example demonstrates how raw time curve data read by PT3S can be used to create both interactive and non-interactive plots with Matplotlib, and to generate a printable output.
