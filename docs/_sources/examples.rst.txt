Examples
========

Welcome to the Examples Page! Here, you will find a variety of examples that demonstrate the capabilities and usage of PT3S. Each example is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.ipynb` file.

.. note::
   Please ensure that you have the **newest version** of PT3S installed to be able to run all examples, because most examples use data, which was added to `PT3S/Examples` with a certain release.
