.. note::

    If you have already installed Anaconda (Jupyterlab) and PT3S and you are familiar with their general usage, you can visit the :doc:`developers` page for more technical information, such as how to contribute to PT3S.

Getting Started with Anaconda
-----------------------------

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. It is designed for data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and more. It simplifies package management and deployment and includes several useful programs, such as JupyterLab and Spyder.

Currently, 3S Consult utilizes JupyterLab for editing and displaying both imported and exported data from SIR 3S, and Spyder for coding PT3S. More details on PT3S Contribution can be found at :doc:`developers`.

For more detailed information, visit the `official Anaconda documentation website <https://docs.anaconda.com/>`_.

How to Install Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Download Anaconda:** Visit the `official Anaconda download website <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ and skip the registration process. Download the version that is compatible with your operating system.
